# Quaternion Cross-modality Spatial Learning for Multi-modal Medical Image Segmentation
This repo is the source code for Quaternion Cross-modality Spatial Learning for Multi-modal Medical Image Segmentation. 

![fig](./models/fig.png)

## Requirements
- python 3.7
- pytorch 1.6.0
- torchvision 0.7.0
- pickle
- nibabel
- SimpleITK
- imageio

### Environment
Please prepare an environment with python=3.7, and then use the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" for the dependencies.

## Data Mounting
Mount the folders of BraTS 2021 training and validation dataset respectively under the folder "data". Modify path and Run "generate_train_list.py" and "generate_validation_list.py" to generate the train.txt and valid.txt, which are required for the next steps. Unzip "output_size_template.zip" and keep the unzipped file where it is, which is worked as a reference for the model to automatically output the segmentation with a proper size.

`python3 generate_train_list.py`

`python3 generate_valid_list.py`

`unzip output_size_template.zip`

Here is an example illustrating the proper way to mount the BraTS 2021 dataset:
"./data/BraTS2021_TrainingData/case_ID/case_ID_flair.nii.gz"
 The generated train.txt should be moved to "./data/BraTS2021_TrainingData/".

## Data preprocess
Modify path and Run "preprocess.py" to generate a pkl file for every case within its case_ID folder, which are required for the next steps.

`python3 preprocess.py`

## Training
Modify path and Run "train.py" with 4 GPUs:
`python3 -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port 20003 train.py`

## Testing 
Modify path and Run "test.py" :

`python3 test.py`


## Validation score
Use the evaluation folder to calculation the Dice Score of the segmentation of the validation data.
